TestNG TDD Framework building steps:

1. Add the project dependencies
2. Add .gitignore file
3. Create the package structure
4. Add utility classes ConfigReader, CSVReader etc
5. Add the testng.xml files for smoke,regression tests etc
6.


ConfigReader - utility class that reads from the .properties file
config.properties - a text file that stores project specific configuration as key-value pairs


Page Object Model - a design pattern that simplifies writing UI tests by creating a separate Page Object Classes where the element of the page are stored. We usually use
Page Object Model along with Page Factory where we use @FindBy annotations and a constructor with factory method PageFactory.initElements() method.
